-- Bill Term Account. Should it be transactional?
-- in SQL all IDs will change when we import and export data.
   So there must be some self generate mechanism to circumvent this prob.
-- GrossAmount, Additions, Deductions, NetAmount, Adjusted, and Balance ??
-- TxnType? does it needed? or can it be guessed from the trans and table?
-- Cash Books?
-- Bank Accounts?
-- Should single table for both Cash Receipts and Payments be handled?
-- What about credit card payments / receipts?
-- Opening Balances Accounts (Customers, Suppliers, Brokers, Bank Balances, Cash Balances etc...)
-- The main company database should include fields for Slowly Changing Data

SalesOrder:
 -- CustomerID, BrokerID... should this be AccountIDs from Account Master?
    or CustomerID and BrokerID from Customer and Broker Masters?
 -- Field Lengths (for Through, Transport) should be compared to prevent
    data trucation while ETL
 -- Should re-check Field Nullability, PK, Unique Keys etc.
 -- Transport could be a shippers or shipping methods
 -- Check if the total amount of lineItems are matching with header amount
 -- BookID: Sale, Purchase, JV ?

IMPORT
======
01. Single account with multiple roles like Customer, Supplier, Broker?
    -- What if user wants keep single acccount?
    -- Our Importer create separate accounts
02. Make Importer to use Generic DAL to allow Export to Any RDBMS(SQL, SQLExpress, SQLCE etc.)
03. Should Cash Sale be imported as single entry for each day? - Yes
04. What should do with Contra Accounts (Daybook Account) and Trans?
05. Import Error Handling and OleDb/SqlCe Exception Handling
06. Opening Transactions (Balances and Stock)? 
    -- What if imported from the middle?
    -- What if imported adhoc years from the middle?
07. Some data like Shipping Address in SalesInvoice is depends on
    AppSetting so there is no other way to know whether inert a record in
    SalexInvocieEx table. -- Check all the fields whther they are blank
08. PricePer and CostrPer should be stored in LineItem also
09. To speedup loading... 
    -- Limit the columns in the quesry instead of reading with T.*, I.*...
    -- Read all the data (header, line-item, terms, masters etc.) at once.
10. Why we would need masters...?
    -- Can we keep also denormalise the master info in the transaction?
11. Data Intergrity Errors: if an account or item code is not found in the
    master table bt referenced in the transaction then it should log them
    -- It should also insert master data with error values like <Error...>
12. BillTerm Master used Daybook: Did not inserted master ??? is it needed?
13. What about Deleted Records in Source Data?
14. Transaction Insert SQL Params Creation: Consolidate all into one
15. SqlCeParameters can be added once and set the value several time to
    increase speed
16. DataImporterClass: Split into Functionality wise (Sale, Purchase...)
17. Source Data: Should check for integrity before starting import by...
    -- checking number of files and thier names...
    -- check the structure of like TXN_FILE.DBF...
18. Should identity whether already imported or not by keeping a 
    -- flag/indicator, or check data exist before insert etc.
    -- can keep and update a flag in the source itself by 
       updating a field in source TXN table or creating a file in folder
19. DataImporter: if a GUI is shown then a progress-meter should be shown
20. What if there are many daybook in each company may have same dbk code
    and dbk-account may be conflict...
