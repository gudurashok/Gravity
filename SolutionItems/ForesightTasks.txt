New Architecture:
- Don't importing full data.
- Build only the aggregate/dimension/fact tables to be used by the reports.
- Remove all the tables other than aggregates
- Copy full source data (only used .dbf files) to Foresight Importdata folder an build the aggregate tables. 
- When a particular report needs full data, use the above copied data directly at that time.
  Note: we can also use data provider source folder but that might have changed since the last import. 
        In this case Foresight can check and prompt for rebuild dimension etc.
- Display an alert message (showing the last imported date/time) during login and somewhere/title (which is allways visible).
- There should also a facility available to create a SqlCe copy of the SqlServer data. 
  This allows moving and running without connect to server when in client/server mode using Sql Server.

0. Check where ever Party grouping checkbox is necessary or not.
0. Refreshing Report rather than <show>: there could be a concept of refresh vs. show. when criteria changes then only the report should be repopulte else it can only show as is.

1. Data cleaning of account address
2. Display Period for each report: Display criteria
3. FMain: Make CommandBar Hidable
4. Try parallel import (Sales, Purchase, Cash)
6. Error Handling: a) non found import codes like a/c, itm, b)
7. AutoFix: Currupted data .DBF
8. Setting for Foresight <Data> folder
9. Remember grid column sizes
10. Import:	Dimension building
11.	Import:	Precalculate possible required values
12. Import: Keeping multiple copies of current year's data while importing
13. <Change namespaces of all classes which are moved to subfolders>
14. Report Snapshoting
15. Cache calculated data for reuse
16. Calculate other reports data in background
18. While importing data all masters [Account (Customers, etc)] are searched by name and full address. 
	For this reason more than one accounts are getting created for the same account/customer.
	Hence all the reports are showing separate records for same account.
	This will affect the quality of the report like Top N customers.
